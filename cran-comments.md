## Note

* This is a new release.
* Unfortunately, there is no published paper yet describing the methods implemented in this package. However, there is a draft paper available on https://github.com/TengMCing/auto_residual_reading/blob/master/paper/paper.pdf which will later be included as a chapter of my PhD thesis. The paper is planned for completion towards the end of this year, coinciding with the conclusion of my PhD program.
